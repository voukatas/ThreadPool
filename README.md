# ThreadPool
A simple ThreadPool that doesn't return results and operates on a queue

## Getting Started
Designed to be used for my other project [Jerry the Http Server](https://github.com/voukatas/jerry) someday or other projects if it fits

All the implementation of the ThreadPool can be found in the ThreadPool.hpp file

A demonstration of the pool can be found in example.cpp file

### Compile & Run
```
g++ example.cpp -lpthread -o example -ggdb3
./example
```
